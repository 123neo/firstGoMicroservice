# firstGoMicroservice

Developers who are starting with go language. This is perfect code for you where there is no complexity of code and easy implementation of Routers and handlers.
Even though i have not yet implemented any request payload or query feature that i will show in different repository.

It's just how the start looks like.

Prerequisites -:

-> You should have go already installed on your system. If not, please visit this link to [install go](https://go.dev/doc/install).


To start these are the steps -:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Open Command Line and go to the cmd directory in repo.
3. run ``` go run main.go ```

and your server starts running on port ``` :8080 ```. If it doesn't give any error that means your server is successfully running.

Now you can on your browser and type url 

``` localhost:8080 ```

you will see the screen saying Root here.
and if you go to the url

``` localhost:8080/hello ```

you will see Hello here.
